** Howm use any markup

In this repo
I want to demonstrate how any markup can be used with
hitori otegaru wiki modoki emacs minor mode and also create commands
that will change emacs major mode in buffer
and add file local variables to set this mode automatically.


*** todos

**** Make idempotent version of function that adds file local variable

It is kinda done.
If mode is already defined my functions wouldn't
add prop-lines with the same mode.

However situation is different if it is other mode.

It seems that functions was designed like this specifically.

Excerpt from the man:

/This command deletes all existing settings of VARIABLE (except ‘mode’/
/and ‘eval’) and adds a new file-local VARIABLE with VALUE to/
/the -*- line./


**** TODO Create a macros, so that I wouldn't need to write seven simillar functions

**** TODO Maybe, use this macros to use any major mode possible, without adding it into package
